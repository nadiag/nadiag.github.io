These three concepts have formed the core of my educational experience as a Professional Writer at Virginia Tech. A perfect world would be one in which these concepts were interwoven into all aspects of life. Therefore, I have made it my goal to incorporate design, content, and usability into everything that I do. When tackling a problem, producing a project, or collaborating with a group, the first question should always be: who is my audience? From there, creating good design and great content follows.</p><p>I started out my college career with a passion for the written word as well as a passion for design. I chose to explore career paths where my passion for content and design could merge to create a product. Incorporating my third passion – helping people – is also important to me. It became apparent to me that through technology, I could design visually pleasing and informative content for people to access and utilize on a global scale.</p><p>Two classes that impacted my goals were Developing Online Content and Feminism and Interaction Design. Developing Online Content gave me the technological savvy to design good content for the web. My Feminism and Interaction Design course taught me how to design in a socially responsible manner. I learned that technology and design create frameworks through which people view the world and conceptualize ideas. These classes inspired me to gain the skills needed to implement innovative, strategic, and creative campaigns that are highly personalized and user-centered.</p><p>The NYU Integrated Marketing Program is the ideal program for me because there is an emphasis on socially responsible design and diversity of experience. This program emphasizes both classroom learning and hands-on experience by implementing internships and special projects. The companies and people that I would have the opportunity to collaborate with through this program would be indispensable to my learning. Working with professors such as Nicole Alexander would be a remarkable opportunity. Having a woman who has studied in London, Paris, and New York City and worked for companies such as Nielsen and The New York Times as a mentor would inspire me to extend my reach further. The curriculum’s grounding in leadership, theory, analysis, and effective methodology and its specialization in digital marketing will equip me with the necessary skills to become a leading innovator in this field.</p><p>Technology has the ability to impact and reach billions of consumers. Harnessing this power and shaping it through good content, good design, and usability is a huge task. Becoming well versed in industry trends, emerging technologies, and new methods of communication is crucial to forwarding progress and innovation. I want to gain the necessary skills and knowledge needed to harness and shape technology in a way that impacts people in a positive manner. Immersing myself in this field at this transformative time would be exciting and rewarding. I aspire to be a driving force of positive social change by connecting users and design, content and technology, innovation and creativity.</p><p><a href="synthesisessay.pdf" target="blank">Click here to download the PDF version of my synthesis essay.</a></p></body></html>
