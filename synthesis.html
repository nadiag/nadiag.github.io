I chose to explore career paths where my passion for content and designcould merge to create a product. Incorporating my third passion – helping people – is alsoimportant to me. It became apparent to me that by utilizing design, content, and technology,I could impact people on a global scale and make the world a better place.</p><p>One project that really inspired me was a client service project that I participated inthrough my Intro to Professional Writing Class. The class was tasked with revising,reorganizing, and condensing part of the volunteer packet for Virginia Tech Adult DayServices. Our goal was to to form a more consistent and concise pamphlet for volunteers. Thisproject sticks out to me because it was the first time that I had used my skills to positivelyimpact the community by improving the lives of the people who serviced that program.Working as a writing center tutor was another experience in which I was able to use myknowledge and skills in order to help others. I enjoyed instilling confidence in students whofelt uncomfortable about their writing abilities.</p><p>Two classes that further impacted my goals were Developing Online Content andFeminism and Interaction Design. Developing Online Content gave me the technological savvyto design good content for the web. My Feminism and Interaction Design course taught mehow to design in a socially responsible manner. I learned that technology and design createframeworks through which people view the world and conceptualize ideas. These classesinspired me to gain the skills needed to implement innovative, strategic, and creativecampaigns that are highly personalized and user-centered.</p><p>My internships with Virginia Tech Human Resources, the Collegiate Times, and BoatAmerica Corporation all equipped me with the skills to target and inform users. I learned howto expand a company’s brand and how to highlight the accomplishments of individuals. Myresponsibilities included creating visually pleasing and informative content and engaging usersvia social media, email, and print marketing materials. Raising awareness in the community ofusers and improving user experience were key aspects of all my internships.</p><p>Technology has the ability to impact and reach billions of consumers. Harnessingthis power and shaping it through good content, good design, and usability is a hugetask. Becoming well versed in industry trends, emerging technologies, and new methodsof communication is crucial to forwarding progress and innovation. I want to utilize thisknowledge and these skills in a way that impacts people in a positive manner. I aspire tobe a driving force of positive social change by connecting users and design, content andtechnology, innovation and creativity.</p><hr class="clear"><img src="footer-pic.jpg" alt="Nadia Groome" class="footer-pic"><p class="footer">Nadia Groome<br><a href="mailto:nadiag@gmail.com">nadiag@vt.edu</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=259851573&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile" target="blank">LinkedIn<a></p></body></html>
