  <h1>English Undergraduate Research Conference T-Shirt Design</h1>

  <p>I collaborated with Kim Koditek to create this t-shirt design for the Virginia Tech English Undergraduate Research Conference t-shirt design contest in my Designing Documents for Print class. We received 2nd place in the design competition. Our task was to create a front and back for a t-shirt that utilizes two colors created in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>The theme for the conference is Engaging Text. We wanted to capture the essence of the theme by combining books with joyfully climbing figures. We aimed to encapsulate the idea of forming playful and out of the box relationships with text. The subtle use of Virginia Techâ€™s colors was meant to get school spirit across in a polished and unobtrusive way, without automatically jumping out at you.</p>
<p>We utilized design concepts such as contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. These concepts influenced our choice of color, font, placement of text, and images. Our audience was the English Department faculty and students, as they were the ones that voted in the competition for the winning design. Our goal was to design a t-shirt that students and faculty would be proud to wear in order to advertise and support the English Undergraduate Research Conference.</p>
